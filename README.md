# Hey, I’m Christopher 👋

I build software systems and try to keep them alive.

## What I’m working on

Most of what I work on is private.
At the moment that’s **Eve** — a company operating system
for jobs, people, permissions, and the parts that don’t behave.

## How I tend to think

I like systems that:
- make responsibility clear
- don’t break when reality is messy
- are still understandable later
- improve through better names, not more structure

Still learning. Still simplifying.
